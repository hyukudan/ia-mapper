# Codebase Overview

Mapper is a Claude Code plugin that maps and documents codebases using parallel subagents, fast scanning, and incremental updates. It produces structured documentation plus optional risk signals to help you navigate and assess a project quickly.

Start here:
- docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md
- docs/CODEBASE_NAV.md
- docs/RISK_SIGNALS.md

If you need to regenerate artifacts, see README.md for the CLI workflow.
